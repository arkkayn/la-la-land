ARCHIVE FOLDER – DO NOT DELETE WITHOUT REVIEW

Purpose:
---------
This folder contains ORIGINAL copies of important Spotsylvania (Spotsy)
documents that were automatically organized by a Python script.

These files were:
1. Copied into organized school-year folders inside:
   Documents/spotsy/<school-year>/
2. THEN moved here to preserve the original files as a backup

No files in this folder have been modified or deleted.

Folder Structure:
-----------------
_archive/
└── <school-year>/
    └── spotsy_originals/
        └── [original files exactly as they existed in Documents]

Example:
--------
_archive/2025-2026/spotsy_originals/

Safety Notes:
-------------
• This archive exists for data protection and peace of mind.
• Files here should NOT be edited or worked from.
• The organized copies in the spotsy folder are the working versions.
• Storage is intentionally duplicated to prevent accidental data loss.

When Can This Be Deleted?
-------------------------
• Ideally, keep this archive for the entire school year.
• Deletion should only occur AFTER:
  - The school year is complete
  - All documents are confirmed accurate
  - A secondary backup exists (Time Machine / external drive)

Created By:
-----------
Python automation script written for safe document organization.
Designed to be non-destructive and reversible.

If unsure: DO NOT DELETE.
